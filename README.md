# quickSelect

Leet Code problem #215 solved using C++11

The main objective is to develop a Quick Select algorithm


 Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the k-th smallest element in the sorted order, not the k-th distinct element.
 For example, given an array {7,3,1,5}, you want to find the 2nd lowest element. Enter k = 2 and the program will return 3.
 
 Note: For simplicity and focus purpose, I am assuming k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length
